This project is for me to practice with FastAPI with the integration with React. 
I would like to be able to help myself build teams of pokemon with the ability to sort through and build a team of 6 with 3 being physical and 3 being special with a good mix of typings.

This might be somewhat difficult as it will be challenging to sort by those stats, but it should be cool to see what kind of data I will have to sort through

I should be able to display images and some moveset ideas as a dropdown to be able to know for the teams that I am building. Especially not needing to go through the sites one by one

So far I have started by displaying stats and will be moving on to movesets next
