This project is for me to practice with FastAPI with the integration with React. 
I would like to be able to help myself build teams of pokemon with the ability to sort through and build a team of 6 with 3 being physical and 3 being special with a good mix of typings.

This might be somewhat difficult as it will be challenging to sort by those stats, but it should be cool to see what kind of data I will have to sort through

I should be able to display images and some moveset ideas as a dropdown to be able to know for the teams that I am building. Especially not needing to go through the sites one by one

So far I have started by displaying stats and will be moving on to movesets next


I realized this morning that I might have to model the data that I am wanting in order to display the correct stats and moves. This will be a lot more work, but it will let me harness sequel a bit more to be able to select pokemon and data based on the games. From what I can tell the data is not super well organized so I think modeling the data myself might be a bit better for accessing and using it.

I'm not aure how I'm going to map each pokemon and their moves. It's gonna be a challenge because of the different generations. I'll have to think about data structure
